  We present \algo, a set of algorithms for drawing transactional datasets from
  a null model, to be used for the statistical validation of knowledge discovery
  results. Our algorithms assume the widely-adopted null model that maintains
  transaction lengths and item supports, and they are based on swap
  randomization, i.e., randomly swapping items between transactions, in a
  Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) setting, using Metropolis-Hastings. In
  contrast with previous work, our approach does not suffer from the distortion
  of the null space introduced by identifying the set of transactional datasets
  with the set of binary matrices, which could lead to unknown false positives
  in the output. \algo\ uses carefully-designed Markov chains with appropriate
  stationary distributions to sample datasets from the null model. The results
  of our experimental evaluation show that \algo\ solves the distortion issue,
  is fast and (empirically) rapidly-mixing, and scales well as the dataset size
  grows.
